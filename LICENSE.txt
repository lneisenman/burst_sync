This code is based on the cited journal articles and associated code where
available. Unfortunately, most of that code did not have a clear license so
I cannot be certain what license should apply. The code that is clearly mine
is the Igor code including code to do burst analysis using the Tcrit and ISI_N
burst definitions and calculate the B statistic synchrony measure. My code is
released under the "simplified" BSD license below. All of my Python, Cython and
C code should also be released under the "simplified" BSD license unless
based on code with a more restictive license such as GPL.

Note that the Python code to calculate the SPIKE syncrhony measure
(burst_sync/spike/original_spike.py) and the C code to calculate the STTC
(burst_sync/sttc/cython_sttc/spike_time_tiling_coefficient.*) are taken
directly from the respective authors and remain their property.
